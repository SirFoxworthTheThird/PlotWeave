/**
 * F-7: a map with no picture was indistinguishable from one being withheld or
 * one that failed to load.
 *
 * The Maps screen already told two states apart — a layer with no picture, and
 * one naming a blob that is not in the store. It could not see a third: a blob
 * record that **is** present and holds a `url`. Every image in the Library is
 * stored that way, so on a train the record resolves, the screen draws its
 * whole frame — sidebar, markers, zoom controls — and the canvas behind it is
 * blank with nothing said.
 *
 * Reproduced before it was fixed, on *The Woman in White* with every remote
 * host refused: the `<img>` reported `complete: true, naturalWidth: 0`, the
 * classic dead-link signature, and the screen text mentioned nothing about it.
 *
 * The remote host is **intercepted rather than relied on** in both directions
 * here, so neither half of this spec depends on the sandbox having a network.
