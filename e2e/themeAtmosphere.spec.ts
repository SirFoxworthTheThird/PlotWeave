/**
 * The theme "atmosphere" is the texture behind the app — grain, hatching, a
 * grid. It is meant to be a whisper, and it was neither behind nor a whisper.
 *
 * It was painted by `body::after` at `z-index: 9999` — the value dialogs use,
 * so it won a tie on document order and drew over cards, dialogs and their
 * text. Noir's light-leak bands ran straight across the words of a modal; they
 * are gone now, and its vignette carries the theme instead.
 *
 * Some of it was not texture at all. Sci-fi's starfield was **two** circles at
 * fixed viewport percentages, which reads as dead pixels; default, cyberpunk
 * and action each drew a single hard-edged band across the whole window, which
 * reads as a scratch on the screen; romance drew concentric rings.
 *
 * The rule that separates the two is shape, not taste: a repeating pattern or a
 * soft radial glow is texture; a single hard-edged line or an isolated dot is a
 * mark. These read the *computed* values, so they check what the browser
 * resolves rather than what the stylesheet appears to say.
