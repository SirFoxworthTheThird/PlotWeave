# UX review — working document

A screen-by-screen review of PlotWeave's interface, started after v1.0.0. The
premise is that a released version is exactly when reworking is affordable, so
nothing here is constrained to small fixes: where a screen would be better built
differently, that is what the entry says.

**This is a working document, not user documentation.** It is a shared list to
argue with, tick off, and eventually delete.

---

## Method

Screens were captured from the real app driven by Playwright at
`deviceScaleFactor: 2`, 1440×900, against two worlds:

- **A populated world** — *The Fellowship of the Ring* imported from
  `example/` with its `.pwb` images. That file carries no `readingMode` flag, so
  it opens in **writing mode**; the dashboard shows the alive/dead split, Scene
  Status, and Writing Progress, all three of which reading mode removes. The
  populated screens are therefore the writer's UI, not the reader's.
- **A brand-new empty world** — created through the real *New World* flow, then
  built up one chapter, one event, and one character at a time, capturing each
  empty screen and each creation dialog on the way.

Reading mode has **not** been reviewed yet, and neither have phone widths.

## Triage — decisions taken

Settled on 2026-08-07. Three cross-cutting questions were answered first,
because they change how a dozen screens read and would otherwise force rework.

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| **X-1** the watermark | **Drop it entirely.** Empty states become the loudest thing on an empty screen, which is what they are for. |
| **X-2** wide screens | **Use the width.** Content and panels expand rather than huddling into a left column. |
| **X-3** the nav rail | **Labels always visible.** Icon + word for every item; the guessing ends. Pairs with the width freed by X-2. |

### Buckets

**A — fix now (18).** Unambiguous defects; no design decision needed. In hand.

`OP-1` `OP-5` `DASH-1` `DASH-2` `DASH-5` `MS-1` `MS-3` `MS-5` `TL-6` `TL-3`
`OP-3` `OP-4` `OP-6` `EV-2` `EV-4` `EV-5` `CB-3` `CB-4` `X-6`

Ordered by value: **OP-1** first (it loses a half-filled form today), then
**OP-5** (every new user is left without a cursor), then the rest.

Added by later passes, same bucket: **`X-10`** (no dialog is a modal — one
component, 21 files' worth of dialogs, and `useFocusTrap` already exists),
**`AI-2`**, **`AI-3`**. **`AI-4`** goes to bucket B: preserving a failed paste
across an accidental close is clearly right, but whether that means a confirm,
a draft, or simply not resetting on backdrop-click is a decision.

**`AI-1` is fixed** (all four AI parsers now share `stripCodeFence`), joining
`OP-1`, `OP-8`, `OP-9` and the mobile map cursor.

**`PH-1` joins the front of the queue with them** — the map showing 2 of 5
markers on a phone is the same class of problem: a headline screen not doing its
one job, measured rather than argued. Later passes also add `SQ-1`, `SQ-2`,
`HP-1`, `X-14`, `PH-2`, `PH-3`, `PH-4` and `ST-2` to bucket A.

**`RD-1`, `RD-2` and `RD-6` are fixed** (see section 22). `RD-7`, found while
fixing them, is left open on purpose — it changes what a whole screen shows in
reading mode, which is a product decision rather than a defect fix.

**`RD-2` jumped the queue; `RD-1` followed it.** `RD-1` was downgraded from high to
med by the depth pass (see the correction in section 22 — its headline example
turned out to be a chapter title, and the gate holds on all eleven routes for
everything it has data about). What survives is a real but latent hole, and
`RD-2` is the reason it could go unnoticed at all: the guarantee spec is
structurally unable to fail on that class. Fix `RD-2` first, so `RD-1` has a test
that can go red. Also added to bucket A from later passes: `X-11`, `X-12`, `X-13`,
`WR-2`, `DF-1`, `DF-2`, `RD-3`, `RD-4`. `DF-3` and `WR-1` are bucket B — both
need a decision (what should a chapter diff compare; how should the inline
editor grow) rather than just a fix.

**B — design work, direction now set (7).** `X-1` `X-2` `X-3` are decided above
and have been done, as have `TL-1` (pacing curve), `ST-1` (structure
proportion) and `REL-1` (graph layout) — the three visualisation findings, and
the only ones of this batch that held up in full when measured. `EV-1`
(event-card disclosure) and `SEL-1` (selector entry points) still need their own
shape before they can be built.

**C — verify before deciding (3).** `CB-1` and the two operations left unproven
in section 10. Cheap; folded into the next pass over those screens.

**D — closed or downgraded (4).** `OP-7` closed as corrected. `OP-2` downgraded:
a modal intercepting clicks is defensible on its own, and only looked wrong
next to OP-1. `SEL-4` (tagline) and `X-5`/`W-2` (permanent help text) are
house-voice calls rather than defects, and wait for someone with an opinion
about the voice.

**OP-2's downgrade was half wrong.** It was filed as "an open palette traps
you" and downgraded on the grounds that a modal intercepting clicks is normal.
That part stands. What did not stand is the assumption behind it — that the
palette was a well-behaved modal. It also survived navigation, which is
**OP-9**, now fixed. The trapping is by design; the outliving was not.

## Cross-cutting

These recur on nearly every screen, so they are worth settling once rather than
per page.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| X-1 | high | **fixed** | **The watermark competes with the content.** A very large PW logo over a map illustration sits behind every screen. On populated screens it shows through the gaps; on empty screens it is the loudest thing in view, with far more visual mass than the actual message. Empty screens read as decorative rather than actionable. **Fixed:** removed. Worth noting the app had already decided this — every named theme (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, …) set `--app-image: none`, so the default was the only one still carrying it. |
| X-2 | med | **fixed** | **Wide viewports are largely unused.** Content columns stop around 55–65% of a 1440px window, leaving a third of the screen as wallpaper, while the panels that *are* shown get cramped. **Measured at 1600px, and the finding was broader than the fault.** The rosters — characters, items, lore, knowledge, factions — already use **97%** of the window; the timeline uses 167% and scrolls by design. The one screen that matched the complaint was the **dashboard at 64%**, capped at `max-w-5xl`. Settings uses 42% and was left alone on purpose: it is a form, and a 1600px-wide text field is worse than a narrow one. **Fixed** for the dashboard, which is tiles and panels rather than prose — now 97%, with a sixth column once there is room. |
| X-3 | med | **fixed** | **14 unlabelled nav icons, one faint divider.** Corkboard, Structure, and Arc are three abstract grid glyphs in a row and cannot be told apart without hovering each. The guide describes a "More" divider separating everyday screens from the rest; visually that split barely registers. **Half of this was already handled:** every rail item carries an `aria-label` and, when collapsed, a `title`, so the names are available — the problem was purely visual. **Fixed:** Dashboard, Corkboard and Arc were three grid glyphs (`LayoutDashboard`, `LayoutGrid`, `TableProperties`); Corkboard is now a sticky note and Arc a curve, which is what each screen actually is. The tier divider gained vertical room so the grouping reads when the "More" label is hidden. |
| X-4 | med | open | **Empty states are inconsistent.** Some are excellent (Arc: heading, explanation, and a CTA routing to the prerequisite). Others are italic grey sentences sitting where a control should be ("No characters assigned.") with no affordance to act. Others are simply blank panels. |
| X-5 | med | open | **Permanent help text.** Explanatory sentences under form fields never go away. The writing is good, but once learned it is noise on every future visit. |
| X-7 | high | **fixed** | **Clickable things that are not controls, inconsistently.** The 18 item cards on the Items roster are not links or buttons — a query for `a, button` inside the main region returns only *Generate with AI*. The corkboard's status pill is the same (**CB-1**). So are the map sidebar's **region rows**: measured, **0** reachable by `role=button`, **8** by div text. So are its **character rows**. But its **location rows are real buttons**. Three different answers inside one sidebar. These are `div`s with click handlers: no keyboard, no screen reader, no focus. **Measured across twelve routes, and it is four problems rather than one:** roster cards (characters 45, items 18, lore 25), the Arc grid's cells (628), the relationship graph's ReactFlow nodes (181), and the pacing curve's SVG points (117). Only the first is the finding as filed, and it is a defect rather than a matter of taste — a card is a way to that entity's page, so it should be a link. **Fixed:** all three rosters are links now, reachable by Tab, openable with Enter, and able to go to a new tab on middle-click. The lore card carries a delete button, and a button inside an anchor is invalid, so it uses the link-overlay pattern — the title is the link and its `::after` covers the card. `e2e/rosterCards.spec.ts` asserts the property (no clickable non-controls in `main`) rather than the markup of one card. **Left open on purpose:** the grid, the graph and the chart each need their own answer — a data grid wants roving-tabindex cell navigation, not 628 links — and are tracked as **X-7a**. **X-7a is now closed, with three different answers.** The Arc grid got roving-tabindex navigation under `role="grid"` (`src/features/arc/gridNavigation.ts`): one tab stop, arrows to move, Home/End and Ctrl+Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, Enter or Space to activate, clamped at the edges rather than wrapping. The pacing curve got a visually-hidden data table — a chart's accessible equivalent is the numbers behind it, and 117 focusable circles would have been worse. The relationship graph got neither: it visualises data that already has an accessible home on each character's Relationships tab, and bolting keyboard navigation onto a ReactFlow canvas would have bought less than the Focus control shipped for `REL-1` already does. |
| X-9 | med | open | **Primary actions disable themselves without saying why.** *Add Location* greys out until Name is filled (**OP-6**); *Save route* greys out until the route has both a name and two points (**RT-1**). Neither marks a required field, shows helper text, or explains itself on hover — the button simply does nothing and the user has to guess which of several fields is at fault. Two instances found without looking for a third. |
| X-10 | high | **fixed** | **No modal in the app is a modal, as far as the browser is concerned.** `DialogContent` (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx:40`) renders a bare `<div>`: no `role="dialog"`, no `aria-modal`, no `aria-labelledby` pointing at the `DialogTitle` it already renders, no focus trap, no focus restore on close. Tab walks straight out of an open dialog into the page behind it; a screen reader is never told a dialog opened; closing one leaves focus wherever it fell. This is **21 files** worth of dialogs — every generation dialog, every create/edit form, the diff modal, the confirms — from one component. `useFocusTrap` (`src/lib/useFocusTrap.ts`) already existed and was already used by the search palette. **Fixed:** the panel now carries `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"` and an `aria-labelledby` resolved from `DialogTitle`; `useFocusTrap` keeps Tab inside; focus moves in on open and returns to the opener on close. One subtlety worth recording — the opener has to be captured during `Dialog`'s **render**, not in an effect: child effects run before parent ones, so for any dialog whose form focuses its first field the "previously focused element" was already an input *inside* the dialog. Guarded by `e2e/dialogA11y.spec.ts`, whose four cases fail one-for-one when each mechanism is removed individually. |
| X-6 | low | open | **Dates are unlabelled and US-format.** `4/1/2026` on a world card — created or edited, April or January? |

---

## 1. World selector

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEL-1 | high | **fixed** | **Five equal-weight entry points, no hierarchy.** Library / Generate from AI / Import World / Import Manuscript / New World. Three mean "I already have something", two mean "I'm starting fresh", and nothing groups them. A newcomer must read all five to find themselves. **Fixed** with two labelled `role="group"`s — *Start something new* and *Bring something in* — rather than a primary button and a menu: all five stay one click away, which matters most for Library, the best first run the app has. The grouping is a real ARIA group, not a visual arrangement, so it reaches a screen reader too. |
| SEL-2 | high | open | **Permanent instructional text in the header** explaining the import file formats — an action nobody has started, described with two extensions (`.pwk`, `.pwb`) a new user has never seen. Belongs inside the import dialog. |
| SEL-3 | med | open | **The world card is poorer than the Library card.** Name, an unlabelled date, a truncated description. No chapter or cast count, no cover art — even for a world whose images were imported. The card seen a hundred times tells less than the one seen once. |
| SEL-4 | med | open | **"Story Tracker" undersells the product.** The guide's own framing — *a story bible for fiction writers* — is more specific and more appealing. |
| SEL-5 | low | open | **"New World" appears twice**, as a header button and as a dashed tile, with no stated relationship. |

**If rebuilt:** two zones. *Start something* — one primary action plus a quiet
"or bring in a draft you already have" that opens a single chooser for
import/manuscript/AI. Then *your shelf*, with cover art, chapter and scene
counts, and relative dates.

---

## 2. World dashboard

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| DASH-1 | high | **fixed** | **The Continuity tile shows `—`.** Every other tile shows a number; the one tile whose entire purpose is to warn you says nothing, and a dash reads as broken or still loading rather than "not run yet". **Fixed** as **X-14**, which is the same defect filed again from a different screen: a tile with no count is an action, not a statistic, and now shows a chevron. Guarded by `e2e/readingModeToggle.spec.ts`. |
| DASH-2 | med | open | **"Character Arc / snapshot coverage / 100%"** — the title names a screen while the metric measures something else. Two concepts in one tile. |
| DASH-3 | med | open | **Recent Events has ambiguous reading order.** Two columns running Ch 6 → 12 → 21 on the left and Ch 1 → 2 on the right; column-major or row-major is unclear, and "recent" is never defined. |
| DASH-4 | low | open | **Ragged tile grid** — four over three, with a hole where the eye expects a fourth. |
| DASH-5 | low | open | **A generic person glyph represents the world**, even when the world has images. |

**If rebuilt:** the dashboard's question is *"what should I do next?"*, not
*"how big is my world?"*. Lead with continuity problems, scenes still in
Idea/Outline, and threads that have gone quiet. Demote raw counts to a thin
strip.

---

## 3. First run — the four-step setup guide

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| NEW-1 | high | open | **The full 14-icon nav rail is present during onboarding**, so every one of a dozen empty screens is one click away from a flow that is trying to guide you. The guide and the freedom undercut each other. |
| NEW-2 | med | open | **The step indicator is four bare numbers.** You cannot see what you are committing to, how long it is, or what step 3 will ask. |
| NEW-3 | med | open | **"Begin" is the label on step 1 of 4** — it reads as "start the wizard", but the wizard has already started; it means "next". |
| NEW-4 | med | open | **Content occupies the top-left third**; the remaining two-thirds is watermark (see X-1, X-2). At this moment — the very first screen of a new world — the impression is emptiness rather than invitation. |
| NEW-5 | low | open | **No way back.** There is a forward action and "Skip and explore on my own", but no step-back once you are past step 1. |

**Credit:** the copy is genuinely good — *"Your story begins with a moment"*,
and placeholders like *"The Age of Embers, The Long Road, Act One…"* teach by
example rather than instruction.

---

## 4. The expanded event card

The densest form in the app, and the one a writer meets most often.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| EV-1 | high | **fixed** | **Roughly a dozen sections, flat and all expanded at once** — description, scene draft, tags, characters, mentions, elapsed time, flashback, story beat, and more below the fold. A scene that has just been created and needs only a title and some prose presents its full ontology immediately. **Fixed** by showing what the scene holds: a section with content renders, and the rest collapse into one row of chips named exactly as the sections they open. The data decides rather than a ranking someone had to invent, nothing is hidden behind a menu or a mode, and choosing *Edit* opens everything. A section's own precondition is unchanged — a world with no maps offers no Location chip. |
| EV-2 | high | open | **The Character States panel is a large empty column** with no empty state at all — no heading explanation, no "assign characters to see them here". It is simply blank. |
| EV-3 | med | open | **The most important field is third.** Scene Draft sits below Description, and Description renders as italic "No description." — which reads as a read-only note rather than something you can click and type into. |
| EV-4 | med | open | **Characters has no visible add control** in the expanded card; just the sentence "No characters assigned." |
| EV-5 | med | open | **Delete sits in the header beside the status pill and the reorder arrows**, giving a destructive action the same weight and neighbourhood as routine ones. |
| EV-6 | low | open | **Focus mode is a very small text affordance** ("Focus  0 words") for one of the nicer features in the product. |
| EV-7 | low | open | **The chapter bar looks broken with one chapter.** A truncated "1 · T…" segment and a clipped "+" read as a rendering fault rather than an empty track. |

**If rebuilt:** title and prose first, everything else progressively disclosed —
a quiet row of "add location / cast / thread / beat" chips that expand on
demand. The full ontology stays available and stops being the default view.

## 5. Doing things — findings from driving a real session

These came from operating the app rather than looking at it: creating a world
through the guide, adding a cast, uploading images, and reaching for the
everyday tools. Each was then **re-verified in isolation**, because the first
run's failures turned out to be mostly bad selectors in the harness rather than
faults in the product. Only what survived that second check is listed.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| OP-1 | high | **done** | **One Escape closes two layers.** Open a dialog (Add Character), press Ctrl+K, and the search palette opens *on top of it*. A single Escape then dismisses **both** — verified: palette `false`, dialog `false` after one press. A user who searches for a name mid-form and presses Escape to get back loses the half-filled dialog and its input. Escape should dismiss the topmost layer only. |
| OP-2 | med | open | **An open palette traps you.** With the palette up, the nav rail is unreachable: the link resolves but the click is intercepted by the overlay, so the only way out is Escape. That is defensible for a modal on its own, but combined with OP-1 it means overlay layering is not being managed deliberately — the palette will happily stack on anything, and Escape does not respect the stack. |
| OP-3 | med | open | **The first-run guide creates more than it says.** Step 1 asks only for a timeline name, under the heading *"Your story begins with a moment"*. Verified by reading IndexedDB straight after: naming a timeline and a character leaves **1 chapter, 1 event, and 1 character** in the world. The chapter and the event were never named, shown, or mentioned — the user then meets a "Ch. 1" and an untitled scene they did not knowingly make. Either say so, or let them name the scene, which is what the heading already promises. |
| OP-4 | low | open | **Two buttons whose names both begin with "Add", adjacent.** On the character step, *"Add a description (optional)"* (a disclosure) sits directly above the primary *"Add them to the story"*. Clicking the wrong one silently expands a field instead of submitting, with no feedback that nothing happened. It cost this review a whole run. |

| OP-5 | high | open | **Finishing the first-run guide leaves no time cursor set.** The pill reads *"All chapters"* the moment the guide ends — verified twice, and visible in the capture. Step 3 of that same guide is headed *"Where does their story begin?"* and places the character at Ch. 1, so the guide selects a moment on the user's behalf and then hands them an app that has forgotten it. Everything cursor-dependent is consequently switched off for a brand-new user who has done everything they were asked. |
| OP-9 | high | **done** | **The search palette outlived the screen it was opened on.** Choosing a result closed it, but arriving anywhere by any other route did not — so a modal sat over an unrelated screen, swallowing every click until Escape. It derailed three separate runs of this review before being recognised as a fault rather than a fluke, which is about as strong a usability signal as a review can produce. Now closed on route change. |
| OP-8 | med | **done** | **Opening search took focus on a 50ms timer.** Whatever had focus kept it until the timer fired, so a keystroke in that window went to the screen behind the palette — open search from a half-filled form, type straight away, and the first characters landed in the form. Found while testing OP-1, not from the screen sweep. Now focused synchronously: the palette renders nothing until it is open, so by the time the effect runs the input is mounted and there is nothing to wait for. **Shipped without a regression test** — see below. |
| OP-6 | med | open | **A disabled primary button with no reason given.** *Add Location* is greyed until Name is filled, with no required marker, no helper text, and no message on hover. Nothing says which field is blocking it. Generalised as **X-9** once *Save route* turned out to do the same thing. |
| OP-7 | low | corrected | **Map placement is gated on the time cursor — and the app says so.** `MapSidebar.tsx` renders the crosshair only inside `{activeEventId && …}`, so with no cursor there is no placement control and no drag. This was first written up as a silent lockout; that was wrong. The sidebar prints *"Select an event from the timeline bar below to place characters onto the map."* The gate is deliberate and explained, so what is left is minor: the 60%-opacity card is a weak signal next to a clear sentence, and the sentence points at the bar rather than offering a way to act. |

**Note on method.** The first attempt at this journey produced fourteen failing
steps that looked like a damning list and were not: a stray palette opened
early, swallowed every click, and everything downstream failed for that one
reason. The rewritten harness makes every step assert **its own effect** rather
than merely not throwing — the earlier version happily reported `OK` for a
click that expanded a disclosure instead of submitting a form. On the second
run **21 of 22 steps passed**, with zero page or console errors.

**OP-7 was overstated and has been corrected.** It was first filed as a silent
lockout, on a reading of the source alone. Checking the running app turned up
an explanatory sentence in the sidebar that the code read had missed, so the
finding drops from *med* to *low* and changes character entirely. It is left in
the table rather than deleted, because the correction is the useful part.

The consequence for **OP-5** sharpens, though: a new user who finishes the guide
lands with no cursor, and the message that tells them what to do points at the
chapter bar — which in a one-chapter world is the clipped, truncated strip filed
as **EV-7**, too small to hit reliably even from a script. The instruction is
correct and the target is poor.

**Still to drive:** the relationship editor, export/import round-trip, chapter
diff, the corkboard and structure boards with real content, and the whole of
this at phone width.

## 6. Timeline

Driven on *The Fellowship of the Ring* (22 chapters, 91 scenes).

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| TL-1 | med | **fixed** | **The pacing curve cannot be read, only glanced at.** No y-axis, no scale, no legend. Dots sit at varying heights in green, yellow and blue with nothing saying what high means, what the colours encode, or which chapter a peak belongs to. The shape is suggestive; the chart is unreadable as data. **Narrower than filed, again.** The chart already drew gridlines at levels 1–5 and already said *"point size = scene length"*, and colour is a redundant encoding of the same value as height, which is fine. Two things were genuinely missing: nothing named the **scale**, so a height meant nothing, and 58 events ran in a row with no way to tell which **chapter** a spike belonged to — the question you bring to a pacing chart. **Fixed:** the five levels are labelled (Calm → Climactic) in a gutter drawn outside the scrolling plot so it stays put while you pan, and each chapter start gets a faint numbered rule. Downgraded high → med, since "unreadable as data" overstated what was absent. |
| TL-2 | med | open | **`Set Active` on all 22 chapter rows.** A text button repeated down the page whose meaning — *move the time cursor here* — is not in its label, competing for attention with the open-detail and delete icons beside it. |
| TL-3 | med | open | **A bare trash icon on every chapter row**, immediately beside open-detail. Twenty-two chances to misclick the most destructive action on the screen, with nothing in the affordance suggesting weight. |
| TL-4 | med | open | **Chapter rows carry a truncated summary and nothing else.** No scene count, no word count, no status roll-up. The row repeats prose you already wrote instead of telling you the state of the chapter. |
| TL-5 | low | open | **Thread pills wrap unbounded.** Nine threads already take two rows and ~80px above the content; the strip grows with every thread added. |
| TL-6 | low | open | **The beat marker on the curve reads "Incite"** — a truncation of *Inciting Incident* that is not a word in this sense. |

## 7. Corkboard

The strongest screen reviewed so far: dense, scannable, and the drag affordance is clear.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| A11Y-1 | med | **fixed** | **Thirteen unnamed buttons out of twenty on chapter detail.** Every scene card carries the same row of icons — move earlier, move later, expand, delete — and none had an accessible name, so a screen reader announced "button, button, button, button" once per scene. Found while verifying CB-1, not filed in the original pass. Naming them was not enough on its own: four buttons all called *Move earlier* are no more use than four with no name, so each says which scene it acts on. |
| CB-1 | med | **withdrawn** | **The status pill is not a button.** The guide says to change a scene's status "right on the card with the status pill", but there is no control with that accessible name — a click driven at it finds nothing. It reads as a static badge, and is one to keyboard and screen-reader users. **It does not hold.** The pill is a `<select>` with `aria-label="Scene status"` overlaid on it at `opacity: 0` — a standard pattern. Driven: three selects found, `selectOption('final')` succeeds, the value reads back, the card re-renders as *Final*, and `el.focus()` lands. The original probe looked for `role=button` and a button with an accessible name, and a select is neither — the same class of measurement error as the five harness failures recorded in §10. Pinned by a test in `e2e/buttonNamesChapter.spec.ts` so it cannot be re-raised from the same measurement. |
| CB-2 | med | open | **No sense of how much board there is.** Five of twenty-two chapter columns are visible, with no scrollbar, count, or overview to say seventeen more exist off-screen. |
| CB-3 | low | open | **Cards carry no length signal.** The corkboard is where scene length should be comparable at a glance; there is no word count on the card. |
| CB-4 | low | open | **Column headers omit their scene count** — "Chapter 1 · A Long-expected Party", but not how many scenes are in it. |

## 8. Manuscript

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MS-1 | high | open | **Find & replace and Export are live on an empty manuscript.** With *0 of 91 scenes written · 0 words*, both remain enabled. Export would compile an empty book; find has nothing to search. |
| MS-2 | med | open | **A bare `0` badge beside the title.** Zero what — words, scenes, chapters? The subtitle answers it a line below, which is where the badge should have got its label. |
| MS-3 | med | open | **`Goal —`** puts an em-dash in a control that looks like an input, the same "reads as broken" pattern as the Continuity tile (**DASH-1**). |
| MS-4 | med | open | **The empty state gives a downloaded book the wrong instruction.** It says *"Write scene prose on your events"* — but library worlds ship deliberately without prose, and nobody is going to type Tolkien's. On a reading-mode world this screen should explain why it is empty, not hand out a task. |

**Credit:** the chapter bar on this screen — named chapters with per-chapter progress ticks — is the best version of that bar anywhere in the app.

## 9. Structure board

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| ST-1 | high | **fixed** | **The board shows sequence but not proportion.** A beat sheet exists to reveal whether Act 2 sags, and this is a flat list of equal-height rows. Nothing conveys that Climax and Resolution both landed in Ch. 22 out of 22, or that Act 1 covers two chapters while Act 2 covers twelve. The one question the screen is for is the one it does not answer. **Held up under measurement.** **Fixed** with two additions, both computed in `buildBeatSheet`. A band above the list divides the book's chapters between the acts at widths proportional to their share, with the conventional 25 / 50 / 25 drawn as dashes to compare against; an act starts at the chapter of the first beat placed in it, so the division is read off the writer's own tagging rather than assumed, and the band holds off entirely until Act 2 and Act 3 each have a beat. Each row then carries a dot on a track at the beat's position along the book, measured by chapter rank so beats sharing a chapter coincide — which is what makes a climax and a resolution both crammed into Ch. 22 visible as two dots at the same place. |
| ST-2 | med | open | **Rows are ~1400px wide with content at both ends** and nothing between (see **X-2**). |
| ST-3 | low | open | **The template switcher is a native select** styled unlike the app's own Select components used elsewhere. |

## 10. What actually happens when you use them

The findings above were written from looking at the writing screens. Going back
and *operating* them — writing prose into scenes, dragging a card between
chapters, replacing a term across the manuscript, exporting a file — changed
the picture, mostly in the product's favour.

**Confirmed working, each with a real check:**

| Operation | Result |
|---|---|
| Prose written on a scene appears in the Manuscript | Verified by asserting the sentence itself appears |
| Find & replace across every scene | Opens, counts matches, replaces across scenes |
| Dragging a scene into another chapter on the corkboard | Verified end to end: *The Birthday Party* moved from Ch.1 to Ch.2 **and the move persisted to IndexedDB**, not just the DOM |
| The export dialog | Format tabs, two options, and a **live word and scene count before you commit** — one of the better-designed dialogs in the app |

That last one matters for how the earlier notes should be read: the corkboard
was called the strongest screen in section 7 *without its main verb having been
tried*. It survives the test.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MS-5 | low | open | **"1 scenes"** in the export dialog's count. Unpluralised. |

**OP-8 has no regression test, deliberately.** Three approaches were tried and
each was rejected: typing immediately after the shortcut is a race against a
50ms window and would be flaky; a frozen `page.clock` turned out **not** to
discriminate at all — the test passed with the timer restored, which makes it
worse than no test; and asserting on the absence of a `setTimeout` tests the
implementation rather than the behaviour. The fix is a small, obviously-correct
simplification and the existing focus assertion in the OP-1 test still covers
"focus lands at all", but nothing guards the *timing*. Recorded rather than
papered over.

**Still unproven, either way:** assigning a beat on the Structure board, the
scene reorder arrows in chapter detail, and whether **CB-1** (the status pill
not being a control) holds up — the pill has no accessible name, which is why
a driven click cannot find it, but that has not been separated from "it is a
button with a different label".

**Method note.** Five of the fourteen operations in this run failed on the
harness, not the app: a card selector that matched a status pill, mouse events
where HTML5 drag needed `dragTo`, and an export click that hit the format tab
rather than the download button. Each was chased down before anything was
written here, because the first instinct — that a failed step is a product
fault — was wrong every single time in this run.

## 11. Across the writing screens

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| W-1 | med | open | **The chapter bar is present on Timeline and Manuscript but absent on Corkboard and Structure**, while the top-bar cursor pill still shows a chapter on all four. The global cursor's main control disappears on two of the screens that are most about story order. |
| W-2 | med | open | **Every screen opens with a title and a line of instruction** — *"Drag scene cards to reorder them…"*, *"The classic seven-beat, three-act spine."* — costing ~110px of vertical space permanently for a sentence read once (see **X-5**). |

---

## 12. The world-element screens

Characters, Items, Lore, Factions and Knowledge share a shape — a counted
roster leading to a detail view — so they are best read against each other.
Driven on *The Fellowship of the Ring*; all eight character tabs render, roster
filtering works, and Lore, Factions and Knowledge all open.

### Character detail

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CH-1 | med | open | **The Overview tab hides most of the character.** It shows the name and biography only. Aliases, map/Arc colour and birth date live behind **Edit**, so you cannot tell whether a character even *has* aliases without entering edit mode. A read view that omits the data is not a read view. |
| CH-2 | med | open | **The name is printed twice** — in the header beside the portrait, and again as a heading directly under the tabs. |
| CH-3 | med | open | **Tabs carry no counts.** Eight tabs, and a character with no goals, no lore and no factions looks identical to one with three of each. Every sibling screen in this group counts things — the rosters, the map sidebar sections — except the one place it would save the most clicking. |
| CH-4 | med | open | **Delete stands alone in the header** as the only icon, top right, with nothing implying weight. Compare Lore, which reveals its delete on hover (see LORE-1). |
| CH-5 | low | open | **The portrait's upload and link controls are two ~10px icons** crowded onto the bottom edge of a 48px avatar. |

### Items

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| IT-1 | high | **fixed** | **The cards are not controls** — see **X-7**, of which this is the clearest instance. |
| IT-2 | med | open | **The roster shows nothing about where anything is.** Items have per-event placement and condition, and the list shows type and description only, so with a cursor set you still cannot see what is where. The map sidebar manages a condition dot per item; the screen devoted to items does not. |

**Credit:** thumbnails, name, category and description make this the most scannable roster in the app.

### Lore

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| LORE-1 | — | **good** | **Delete appears on hover**, not permanently. This is the pattern **TL-3** and **CH-4** should adopt rather than a trash icon sitting on every row forever. |
| LORE-2 | med | open | **Nothing on a card says whether it is gated.** *Revealed at* is a headline lore feature; a page revealed in chapter 17 is indistinguishable from one visible from the start. Knowledge solves the same problem with "known by 4 / 45". |
| LORE-3 | low | open | **Every card shows the same unlabelled US-format date** (`4/7/2026`) — the import date, on all 25 (see **X-6**). |

### Factions

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| FAC-1 | med | open | **Faction-to-faction stances are invisible.** Cards carry a member count only, yet stances are a headline feature — and for a story like this one, who is hostile to whom is the whole point. |
| FAC-2 | med | open | **No search box**, while Items, Knowledge, Lore and Characters all have one in the same position. Fine at ten factions; the inconsistency is the finding. |
| FAC-3 | low | open | **Card titles truncate while their descriptions wrap.** *"The Fellowship of the R…"* is cut at 29 characters directly above two full lines of body text. |

### Knowledge

The best-designed screen reviewed so far.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| KN-1 | — | **good** | **"Suggested from your story"** proposes real work — *"+ Barrow-wight is dead · Ch. 8"* — and adds it in one click. The strongest affordance in the app; the pattern the dashboard wants (see the DASH rebuild note). |
| KN-2 | — | **good** | **"known by 4 / 45"** on every card: a number that means something at a glance. |
| KN-3 | low | **corrected** | **The *when* is on the detail panel, not the roster.** Filed as "missing from the screen about when" before the detail panel had been opened. It is not missing: the panel carries **Reader learns at** (*Ch.10 — Gandalf's Delayed Letter*), **Becomes true at**, and a **Known by** list naming the event each character learned it at. What stands is much smaller — the *roster card* shows only the count, so you cannot scan reveal order without opening facts one at a time. |
| KN-4 | low | open | **No ordering control** — 21 facts in a fixed order, with no way to sort by reveal point or by how widely known they are. |

**Not established:** the "open a fact" step passed against a verify that matched
`known by` text already on the roster, so it proved nothing about the detail
view. Knowledge detail is therefore **unreviewed**, not reviewed-and-fine.

---

## 13. Arc grid, Maps, Relationships, Continuity

### Character Arc grid

The best use of screen width in the app, and the counter-example to **X-2**:
full-bleed columns, a legend at the foot, and the interaction spelled out
(*"Click a column to set cursor · Click a notes cell to expand"*).

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARC-1 | med | open | **Empty rows drown the signal.** 45 characters × 22 chapters, and a dozen rows (Arwen, Boromir, Cave-troll, Celeborn, Durin's Bane…) are entirely blank. There is no way to hide characters with no recorded state, so the grid is mostly emptiness at exactly the scale it is meant for. |
| ARC-2 | med | open | **Inherited state is styled like recorded state.** Bilbo shows *"Argues with Gan…"* verbatim in all eleven visible chapters. A small clock glyph marks the carried-forward cells, but the text reads at full weight, so eleven inherited cells look like eleven decisions. |
| ARC-3 | low | open | **Alphabetical only.** Barrow-wight and Bill the Pony sort above Frodo; no ordering by appearances or by importance. |

### Maps

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAP-1 | high | **fixed** | **The default view is illegible.** Opened at *All chapters* on the shipped example, roughly fifteen label pills pile onto one another across the north of the map — *"16 characters"*, *"3 characters"*, *"Glorfindel"*, *"The Watcher in the Water"*, *"Trollshaws"* — several completely hidden behind others. There is no collision avoidance, no decluttering, and no zoom-dependent thinning. This is the arrival state of the app's most visually impressive screen.. **Measured on a shipped world with images: 9 overlapping label pairs from 11 markers.** The map already had a per-marker dot-only icon mode built in — and a filter that turned *every* label off at once — but nothing joined them up, so `showLabel` was a parameter no caller ever passed `false`, and the only way to read a crowded map was to lose every name on it. **Fixed:** `labelDeclutter.ts` decides per marker whether its pill clears the ones already placed, in a stable order, with the selected marker exempt; the rest fall back to the dot that already existed, and zooming in brings the names back. Label-on-label collisions go **9 → 1**, with 5 of 11 keeping their names. The survivor is a location label against a *character* pin, which is a separate icon path and a separate problem. |
| MAP-2 | med | open | **The floating toolbar sits on top of content.** *+ Location / Label / Measure / ⋯* overlaps a marker and its label in the top-right corner. |
| MAP-3 | med | open | **The sidebar contradicts itself.** It says *"Select an event from the timeline bar below to place characters onto the map"* while listing every character with a location beneath it (*Aragorn · Weathertop*). Both are true — placement needs a cursor, display does not — but read together they do not make sense. |

### Relationships graph

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| REL-1 | high | **fixed** | **The graph does not survive its own example.** 45 characters produce a knot in the upper third with unreadable overlapping edge labels, while unconnected characters are flung hundreds of pixels away — so distance reads as meaning when it carries none. Both side thirds are empty. There is no re-layout, no clustering, no filter to one character's neighbourhood, and no way to reduce what is drawn. **Held up, and the cause was one line.** Every character went onto a fixed four-column grid — 880 × 1920 for a cast of 45, so `fitView` zoomed out to swallow the height and left both side thirds empty, and a grid slot said nothing about who knew whom. **Fixed** with a deterministic force layout (`graphLayout.ts`): relationships pull, every pair inside a cutoff pushes, connected groups are shelf-packed towards 16:9, and characters with no relationships are gathered into a block of their own instead of being scattered through the grid. The repulsion cutoff matters on its own — without it a chain of fifteen drew its links half again as long as a chain of five's, so the same relationship had two lengths depending on cast size. Three controls followed: **Tidy up** re-runs the layout and drops hand-placed positions, **Focus** draws one character's neighbourhood at one or two hops with a count of what is shown, and edge labels are dropped below the zoom at which they are legible — with a note saying so, since `fitView` on a twenty-character world lands at 0.33 and silence there would read as "this graph has no labels". |
| REL-2 | med | open | **The minimap is unreadable** — a smear of dim blue on near-black with no visible viewport rectangle, in the one situation where a minimap should be earning its place. |

### Continuity Checker

Well built: grouped by category with counts, a suppress control and a jump
control on every row, and keyboard hints at the foot (*↑↓ navigate · Enter go
to event*).

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CC-1 | high | **fixed** | **The model has no notion of a thing there is more than one of, and the checker reports it as an error.** *"Barrow-blades appears in multiple places in Ch. 12 — Held by: Meriadoc, Peregrin, Samwise, Frodo"*. There are four barrow-blades, one each. Same for *Elven Cloak* and *Lembas*, held by six characters apiece. Almost all of the 79 item errors are this class. It is a modelling gap surfacing as a wall of false positives, and false positives are how a checker teaches people to ignore it. |
| CC-2 | high | **fixed** | **The shipped example reports 72 errors and 25 warnings.** Someone who downloads *The Fellowship of the Ring* and clicks the shield meets 97 problems in a world they did not write. Either the example is wrong or the checks are, and either way that is the first impression the feature makes. **Measured: the checks are.** Running the checker over the shipped fixture, **71 of the 97 issues are a single rule** — *"X appears in multiple places"* — and the three items it fires on are *Lembas* (6 simultaneous holders), *Elven Cloak* (6) and *Barrow-blades* (4). All three are things there are several of, so the example data is right. **Fixed as CC-1**, which drops the Fellowship from **97 issues to 23, and from 72 errors to 1** — the survivor being a genuine fixture slip (Gandalf alive in Ch. 22 after dying in Ch. 17), and most of the rest legitimate observations about the novel rather than faults. |
| CC-3 | med | open | **No triage within a category.** *Items 79* is one repeated fault; nothing groups by kind, so the real findings are buried under the noise from CC-1. |

**Correctly caught, for the record:** *"Gandalf the Grey is alive in Ch. 22 after
dying in Ch. 17"* is exactly right for this book, and the eye icon beside it is
the right answer.

## 14. Using the map as a writer

Not looking at the map — working it. Opening the shipped *Fellowship*, asking
where everyone is at a given chapter, following one character, drilling into a
city, playing the story back, and stepping the cursor forward to watch the cast
move.

**What works, measured rather than assumed.** The map genuinely tracks the
story: markers drawn fall **43 → 31 → 24 → 16** as the cursor moves from *All
chapters* to Ch.6, Ch.11 and Ch.21. Drilling into *Minas Tirith* works and
returns cleanly. Playback runs and redraws. The bottom chapter bar — segments
with per-scene ticks, the current chapter picked out, the active scene named
beside it — is the best navigation in the product, and on this screen it is
doing real work.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MW-1 | high | open | **Label collision is not just an *All chapters* problem.** With the cursor on Ch.6 the north of the map still stacks *Trollshaws* / *Rivendell* / *High Pass* / *The Bruinen Ford* on one another, and *Dimrill Dale* / *Lothlórien* / *Dol Guldur* on each other. Setting a moment — the app's whole premise — does not make the map readable. This extends **MAP-1** rather than repeating it. |
| MW-2 | high | open | **Two contradictory scales are on screen at once.** The breadcrumb states *1 km = 2 px*, while the map artwork carries its own printed scale bar in **miles**. A writer measuring a leg of the journey has no way to know which one the answer will come back in, and the two cannot both be right. |
| MW-3 | med | open | **"Who is where" is buried in a list of everyone.** With the cursor on Ch.6 the sidebar lists all 45 characters at equal weight, each with a placement crosshair, but only a handful carry a location beneath their name. The question the screen exists to answer — *who is on stage now* — is a minority of the rows, undistinguished from the rest. |
| MW-4 | med | open | **Regions are labelled twice.** *Rohan* appears as a polygon label and again as a marker pin reading *Rohan · Region*; *Mordor* likewise, with the two labels overlapping. |

### The three that were unproven — now settled

All three work. Each was measured rather than eyeballed.

| Feature | Result |
|---|---|
| **Journeys** | Works, and needs no character selected. Overlay paths go **5 → 17 → 5** across off/on/off, so the lines are genuinely drawn and genuinely removed. |
| **Measure** | Works. Two points on the Middle-earth map report **"101 km"**. |
| **Film strip** | Works on a *single-character* pin. Clicking Radagast at Rhosgobel lists his stop as *"Ch.14 — The Council of Elrond"*. |

Chasing them turned up three new faults and hardened a fourth.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MW-5 | high | open | **Measure mode does not take exclusive control of the canvas.** With Measure armed, the first click both places the point **and selects the region polygon underneath**, opening its detail panel over the right of the map — verified: a region panel was open and the tool was still in Measure mode. On the first attempt that panel covered the spot intended for the second point and swallowed the click entirely, so the measurement could not be completed at all. A mode that says "click two points on the map" has to own those two clicks. |
| MW-6 | med | open | **A cluster popup renders off the top of the viewport.** Clicking a "16 characters" pin opens a list whose first entry (*Meriadoc Brandybuck*) is cut off above the canvas, behind the toolbar. It is not scrolled into view and cannot be reached. |
| MW-7 | med | open | **"(sub-map)" tells you nothing useful.** Fourteen of the sixteen names in that list read *"Frodo Baggins (sub-map)"*, *"Sauron (sub-map)"*. It presumably means the character is really on a child map and is being shown at the parent pin — but it does not say **which** map, and repeated on nearly every row it reads as noise rather than information. |
| MW-8 | low | open | **A cluster pin and a character pin do different things without saying so.** A single pin opens the film strip; a cluster opens a plain member list with no strip and no way to reach one. |

**MW-2 is now firmer, not weaker.** The measurement came back in **kilometres**
on a map whose own printed scale bar is in **miles**. Both are on screen at
once and they disagree.

## 15. Worlds with several timelines

Driven on two shipped examples, deliberately of different kinds: **The Two
Towers** (parallel storylines) and **The Name of the Wind** (frame narrative).
The guide says these get different bottom bars, and they do.

**Correct, and verified rather than assumed:**

- The **scope selector** is present on the parallel world and **absent** on the
  frame narrative, which instead gets two stacked tracks — exactly as
  documented, checked both ways.
- The **All timelines** tab is offered in both.
- Timeline tabs carry colour dots, and the **arc grid** offers matching pills
  (*All · The Road to Mordor · Rohan and Isengard*), so the same colour means
  the same storyline in two places.
- **Link Timelines** appears in the header only when there is more than one.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MT-1 | high | open | **In the frame-narrative bar, the outer track loses its chapter titles while the inner keeps them.** The top track reads `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 13 17 25 45 48 57 75 88 92 93` — bare numbers — directly above an inner track reading *8 · Thie…*, *12 · Puz…*, *22 · A Time for…*. The same component renders at two densities side by side because segment width follows event count, so the *frame* of a frame narrative is the half you cannot read. |
| MT-2 | med | open | **Two play buttons, one per track, with nothing to say what either does.** Neither is labelled for its track, and nothing states whether playing one moves the other, or which one is "play the story". |
| MT-3 | med | open | **The stacked bar costs roughly 150px of height permanently** — two rows on every screen in the world, on a surface where the map and the manuscript both want the vertical space. |
| MT-4 | low | open | **A timeline's chapter count and its first chapter number disagree on sight.** *The Road to Mordor (10 chapters)* opens at **Ch. 12**, because numbering runs globally across timelines rather than per timeline. That is right for a book published as two halves, but nothing on the screen says so, and "10 chapters" starting at twelve reads as missing data. |

### Sync points and the "ghost cursor line"

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| MT-5 | high | **done** | **The guide described a feature that does not exist.** It said a *"ghost cursor line marks the corresponding moment on the other track"*. There is no such line. `syncPoints` appears in exactly one place in the source — `useTimelinePlayback.ts` — and `StackedTrack` is never given the sync-point data, so it could not draw one. Confirmed in the running app: with the cursor set to Ch.6 of the outer timeline, there are **zero** dashed, dotted or ghost-styled elements anywhere on the page. `docs/GUIDE.md` now describes what sync points actually do. |
| MT-6 | med | open | **Sync points only work one way, and only while playing.** They fire when playback advances the **inner** track onto a paired event, moving a hidden outer cursor that only the **map** reads (for ghost pins). Playing the outer track syncs nothing, and moving the cursor by hand syncs nothing in either direction. A writer who pairs nine moments and then scrubs between them sees no effect at all. |
| MT-7 | med | open | **Nothing on the bar shows which moments are paired.** Having set up sync points, there is no mark on either track saying "this one is linked" — so the only way to know a pairing exists is to open the relationship editor and read the list. |

**What sync points really do**, for the record: during playback of the inner
timeline, reaching a paired event sets `activeOuterEventId`, which
`useMapViewState` uses to resolve the outer timeline's snapshots and draw its
cast as ghost pins on the map. That is a genuinely good feature — cutting back
to the frame while the map shows both casts — and it is invisible everywhere
except the map, during playback, in one direction.

---

## 16. The map sidebar, and the panels that open on the right

Asked for directly, and fairly — the left bar had one finding against it
(**MW-3**) and the right-hand panels had never been looked at.

### The left sidebar

Sections: Map Layers · Characters · Locations · Items · Routes · Regions, each
with a count in its header, which is the right idea and done well.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| SB-1 | high | open | **Opening the sections produces one unbounded scroll.** They are not an accordion and their headers do not stick, so with Items expanded (18 rows) *Map Layers*, *Characters* and *Locations* have all scrolled off the top. In a 22-chapter world with 29 locations and 45 characters, opening two sections makes the third unreachable without hunting. |
| SB-2 | med | open | **Names are truncated far earlier than the column requires.** *The Witch-kin…*, *Samwise Gam…*, *Radagast the …*, *Bow of the Galad…*, *The Mirror of Gal…* — cut at roughly fourteen characters in a 280px column. *The Witch-king of Angmar* and *The Witch-king of the North* would be indistinguishable. |
| SB-3 | low | open | **Only some rows carry their per-event state.** At a given chapter a handful of characters and items show a location line and the rest show nothing, at identical weight — the list version of **MW-3**. |

**Example-data note:** at Ch.12 the sidebar reads *Sauron · Bag End*. That is the
shipped Fellowship example, not the UI, but it is the kind of thing a reader
will screenshot.

### The location panel

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| LP-1 | high | open | **Delete is the loudest thing in the panel.** *Delete Location* is a full-width, saturated red bar pinned to the bottom, more visually dominant than the location's own name. Lore hides its delete until hover (**LORE-1**); this is the opposite extreme, on the panel a writer opens most often. |
| LP-2 | med | open | **The panel is clipped by its own delete bar.** *Upload Sub-map* is cut in half by it, so the last section cannot be read or reached at the default height. |
| LP-3 | med | open | **Three sections in a row send you somewhere else and none of them takes you there.** *Characters here* wants an event; *Controlling Faction* says "create one in the Factions view"; *Lore* says "open a lore page and use the link button". The copy is clear and correct — and there is not a single link among the three. |
| LP-4 | low | open | **The name is shown twice and the header carries neither.** The map popup reads *Saltmouth · City*, the panel repeats *Saltmouth · City* immediately beside it, and the panel's own header says only *"Location"*. |

**Credit:** the empty states here are among the better-written in the app —
they say what is missing *and* why, rather than just reporting absence.

### The character panel

The best of the panels, and the yardstick the others should be held to. Its
header carries **the moment** — *Frodo Baggins · Ch.12 — Flight to the Ford* —
then portrait, an **Alive** badge, the status note in his own words, travel
mode, location, inventory with per-item remove and *+ Add item…*, inventory
notes, and relationships.

Clicking a character in the sidebar also opens the **film strip** along the
bottom — *The Party Tree Ch.1 · Bag End Ch.1 · Hobbiton Ch.3 · Woodhall Ch.3 ·
Shire Ch.4 …* — which is the feature earlier passes kept failing to reach.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| PAN-1 | high | open | **The four panels share no contract.** The character panel names the moment in its header; the location panel's header says only *"Location"*. The location panel ends in a full-width saturated red **Delete Location**; the character panel has no delete at all. Same edge of the same screen, opened the same way, and they disagree about what a panel is. |
| PAN-2 | med | open | **Selecting a character costs two rows of chrome.** The right panel and the film strip open together, and the strip stacks above the chapter bar — so a laptop loses the panel width *and* roughly a third of the remaining map height in one click, with no way to keep one without the other. |

### The region panel — still not opened

Not for want of trying. It is **not reachable by role**: measured, zero region
rows respond to `role=button` and eight to a div-text query, because the rows
are `div`s with click handlers (**X-7**). That is not a harness excuse — it is
the finding. A keyboard user cannot open the region panel at all.

The route panel remains unreviewed as well.

---

## 17. Writer's Brief, Calendar, Knowledge detail, Settings

### Knowledge detail — the best panel in the app

Header carries the fact's own title. **Reader learns at** and **Becomes true
at** are both explicit, each with a line explaining what it does — *"Anyone who
knows it before this is flagged by the continuity checker."* **Known by (4)**
lists each character beside the event they learned it at, with a remove control,
and a *Character… / Learns it at… / Record who learns it* row to add more. This
is what **KN-3** was wrongly filed against, now corrected.

### Writer's Brief

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| WB-1 | med | open | **A full-height panel to deliver one sentence.** With no cursor set it says *"Select an event from the timeline bar to see the brief"* and nothing else — roughly 440px of screen for a single line, on the tool the app promotes most. Worse, it does not help: the Arc and Calendar empty states both offer a button that takes you to the prerequisite, and this one offers no way to pick an event at all. |
| WB-2 | med | open | **The panel has no backdrop.** The timeline underneath stays fully lit and is sliced off mid-sentence at the panel edge (*"…using his magic ring"*, *"…the Dark Lord Sauro"*), so the page reads as truncated rather than overlaid. The search palette dims its background; this does not. |

*The populated brief remains unreviewed — the cursor was at* All chapters *for this capture.*

### Calendar

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CAL-1 | — | **good** | **An exemplary empty state**: *"No calendar yet"*, one line saying what the view is for, and **Open World settings** — the prerequisite, one click away. This and the Arc grid are the pattern **X-4** should standardise on. |
| CAL-2 | low | open | **The nav item is present when the feature cannot work.** Calendar sits in the rail whether or not a calendar exists, so the first visit is always a dead end. |

### Settings

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| SET-1 | high | open | **Settings offers to override a setting that cannot be set.** The Theme section reads *"Override the global app theme for this world"* and its first card is **Inherit global theme** — but there is no global theme control anywhere in the app. `ThemePicker` is exported and never rendered. So the default option inherits from a value the user has no way to change, and the explanatory sentence describes a screen that does not exist. |
| SET-2 | med | open | **Ten sections in one unbroken scroll** — world, reading mode, theme, travel modes, continuity, calendar, manuscript, timelines, database health, folder sync, export — with no tabs, jump links, or section index. |
| SET-3 | low | open | **Inline pencil affordances.** Name and Description are edited through small pencil glyphs, the Description one floating at the right of a three-line paragraph with no clear anchor. |

### One more cross-cutting

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| X-8 | med | open | **The shipped examples leave several features undemonstrated.** *The Fellowship of the Ring* has no scene prose (so Manuscript, Find & Replace, Focus mode and Cast Balance are all empty), no calendar (so the Calendar view is a dead end), and no cover image (so its world card shows the generic glyph). Someone exploring the flagship example meets four blank screens in a row and has no way to know the features work. |

---

## 18. A writing session — chapter detail with real content

Not screenshots this time: opening chapter twelve of *The Fellowship of the
Ring* to work on it, reading who is in the scene, leaving a note, opening the
brief alongside, and tracing a route on the map.

**Verified working.** *Writer's Notes* takes a note, says **Auto-saved**, and
the note is still there verbatim after a full reload. Checked by asserting the
exact text, not the presence of a textarea.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| CD-1 | high | open | **The Character States panel leads with everyone who is not there.** On *Ch.12 — Flight to the Ford*, a scene with five named characters, the panel's dominant content is **"36 characters not in any event:"** followed by Arwen, Barliman, Barrow-wight, Bilbo, Bill Ferny, Boromir, Cave-troll, Celeborn, Durin's Bane, Déagol, Elendil, Elrond… each marked *no snapshot*. The writer's question is "who is here and what state are they in"; the screen answers with a roll-call of the absent. The five who *are* in the scene are listed in the event card on the left instead. |
| CD-2 | high | open | **Opening a chapter does not put you in it.** After opening Ch.12 the cursor still reads *All chapters* — so every per-moment tool stays dark. Measured in the same session: the **Writer's Brief opened empty**, still saying *"Select an event from the timeline bar to see the brief"* while chapter twelve was on screen. A writer who opens a chapter to draft it has to go and find the bottom bar and set the cursor by hand before the app will tell them anything about the moment. |
| CD-3 | low | open | **`Day 6223`** sits as a badge on the event. With no calendar configured that is a raw day count from an arbitrary zero, presented with the same weight as the scene's status and tension. |

**CD-1 and EV-2 are the same fault from opposite ends.** On an empty world the
Character States panel is blank with no explanation; on a full one it is packed
with irrelevance. Neither version keys off the scene's actual cast, which is
the only thing the panel is for.

### Drawing a route

Three attempts failed to complete a route. The fourth traced the cause, and the
cause is the finding rather than an excuse.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| RT-1 | med | open | **Save route is disabled until the route is named, and nothing says so.** The control exists and is well labelled — *Save route*, with a tick. It is `disabled` while `waypoints.length < 2 \|\| !name.trim()`. Placing three points and pressing it therefore does nothing at all, silently, because the *name* field above is empty. The HUD does show a live "3 points" counter, which hints at the waypoint half of the condition; there is no equivalent hint for the name, no required marker on the field, and no tooltip on the dead button. See **X-9**. |

**The route HUD is otherwise well made** and worth saying so: it opens with
*"Drawing route — click anywhere to add points"*, offers the six route types as
chips, names each waypoint as you place it (*Point*, or the marker's name if you
click one), keeps a live point count, and has Undo beside Save.

**The route detail panel is still unreviewed** — but now for a known reason
rather than an unexplained one.

---

## 19. The AI generation dialogs

Ten of them exist. Nine share one component (`GenerateSectionDialog`) through thin
per-section wrappers; `ChapterAIDialog` and `MapAIDialog` are bespoke. This is the
route by which most of a world's content is meant to arrive, so it was driven
rather than read: a world spec into the generator, and a nested locations tree —
regions, sub-places, and a keep with floors — into the locations dialog.

**The shared dialog is the best-designed surface reviewed so far**, and that is
worth stating before the findings. It numbers the four steps in order, shows the
whole prompt in a scrollable pre with a sticky *Copy prompt* button, parses as you
type, previews the count *before* committing (*"Ready to import 5 locations. New
ones are added; ones that already exist are updated in place."*), reports the
result afterwards (*"Added 3 characters"*, with updated/unchanged counts), and
swaps *Cancel* to *Done* once it has run. The locations prompt even feeds the
existing place tree back to the assistant so it extends the world instead of
duplicating it. Nothing else in the app explains itself this well.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI-1 | high | **fixed** | **Fenced JSON was rejected as invalid by half the parsers.** Every prompt ends with "no markdown fences"; assistants add them anyway. `sectionImport` stripped them, `MapAIDialog` stripped them with its own private regex, and **`worldSpec` and `ChapterAIDialog` did not strip them at all** — so a first-time writer pasting a perfectly valid, fenced world spec was told *"That isn't valid JSON."* about JSON that is valid. The two bespoke dialogs, the ones a writer is most likely to reach for first, were the two that failed. Fixed: `stripCodeFence` moved to `src/lib/codeFence.ts` and all four parsers now share it. |
| AI-2 | low | **fixed** | **Unrecognised keys are dropped in silence.** A tree that put a floor's rooms in `levels[].locations` instead of the documented `levels[].children` imported "successfully": the floors were created empty, the two rooms vanished, and nothing anywhere said so. The count line was honest — it said 5, and 5 arrived — so the only signal available to the writer is noticing later that rooms they asked for are missing. The prompt documents `children` correctly and this was my own malformed paste, but an assistant drifting one key from a long spec is exactly the failure this flow should catch. A "2 unrecognised fields were ignored" note under the preview would cost little. **Fixed:** the locations parser collects keys it does not recognise and the dialog shows them beside the count — *"Ignored one field this app doesn't recognise: “locations”. Anything under it was not imported."* The tests pair a drifted key against a spec in the documented shape, so the warning cannot fire on every ordinary import. The other section parsers could adopt the same helper; only locations, where nesting makes drift likely, is wired up. |
| AI-3 | low | **fixed** | **Three different messages for the same failure.** "That isn't valid JSON. Paste the JSON the AI returned." (`sectionImport`), "Could not parse JSON. Make sure you copied the full response." (`ChapterAIDialog`), "Could not parse JSON. Make sure Claude returned raw JSON only." (`MapAIDialog`). The last also names one assistant, while every dialog's own intro correctly says "any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini…)". **Fixed:** all four share `INVALID_JSON_MESSAGE` from `src/lib/codeFence.ts`. A unit test asserts the message names no particular assistant and that every parser returns exactly it, paired with a parse *success* so the check cannot pass vacuously. |
| AI-4 | med | **fixed** | **Nothing survives closing the dialog.** `reset()` clears the pasted text on every close, including an accidental Escape or a click on the backdrop — and the backdrop is the whole screen. A long paste that failed to validate is gone, with no confirm and no undo, and the writer has to go back to their assistant for it. See **X-10**, now fixed, which also makes *Cancel* reachable by keyboard. **Fixed:** closing no longer clears the box. A successful import already clears it, so the paste survives only while it is still unused — no confirm needed, and nothing accumulates. |

**Not a finding, recorded so it isn't re-investigated:** duplicate map-layer names
after a levels import (two layers both called "Keep of Ash") are correct. Floor
layers are named after their marker, with the floor name carried in `levelLabel`
(`sectionImport.ts:1198`). Likewise, an early probe suggesting no result banner
appears after a locations import was a harness artefact — the banner is real
(`GenerateSectionDialog.tsx:134`) and shared by all nine wrapper dialogs.

**Still unopened in this group:** the sequel wizard, manuscript import, and the
paste-back half of `ChapterAIDialog` and `MapAIDialog` driven end to end with a
real assistant response.

---

## 20. The writing screens, with real prose in them

Everything above was driven against worlds with structure but no text. This pass
wrote a scene, revised it, restored it, and compared chapters — the loop the app
exists for.

**Focus mode is the best screen in the product.** Full-bleed, serif, generous
line height, a measure of about 75 characters, the scene title top-left and
`882 words · Esc to exit` top-right, and nothing else. It top-aligns and scrolls
correctly with 880 words in it, and the live `(+3 this session)` counter appears
as you type. I went looking for problems here and found one cosmetic one (below).

**Scene history is nearly as good.** Word-level diff, a `+23 −12 words to reach
current` summary, `Diff vs current` / `This version` toggle, and a **Restore
confirm whose copy is the best in the app**: *"The current prose will be saved as
a new version first, so you can undo this."* It then keeps that promise — I
restored, and the top-bar Undo was live afterwards.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| WR-1 | med | open | **The scene-draft editor is a five-line box.** In chapter detail, 882 words of prose sit in a fixed `~5`-row textarea with an internal scrollbar — you write a novel through a letterbox. There is a resize handle and a *Focus* button, and Focus mode is excellent, but the default inline experience for the app's central activity is cramped. Auto-growing the textarea to its content would cost little. |
| WR-2 | med | **fixed** | **The scene-history diff runs deletions and insertions together with no separator.** `"years, and it showed.years."`, `"onea solidsingle piece,seized lump"` — the red strikethrough run and the green inserted run are adjacent with no space, so short substitutions read as garbage and the writer has to mentally unpick which half is which. A thin gap, or a `→`, or side-by-side columns would fix it. The diff itself is correct; only its typography is at fault. **Fixed:** each changed run is now a padded pill with a margin, and `splitEdges` keeps the highlight off the surrounding whitespace so the block hugs the words that actually changed. `e2e/sceneHistory.spec.ts` measures the gap between adjacent highlights and reports `0px apart` without the change. |
| WR-3 | low | open | **The watermark bleeds into Focus mode.** X-1's diagonal background band is faintly visible behind the prose on the one screen whose entire purpose is to remove everything but the prose. |
| DF-1 | med | open | **Chapter Diff is invisible until you activate an event.** Measured: `Compare chapters` is present **0** times on the timeline, and **1** time after clicking an event in the playback bar. A headline feature is gated behind an unrelated action with nothing to hint at the connection — opening a chapter is not enough, and neither is selecting one. |
| DF-2 | low | open | **Chapter Diff opens empty when only one comparison is possible.** With two chapters in the world, the base is filled in (`Base: Ch. 1 — The Gate`) and the other side is an unselected `Compare with…` whose only real option is Ch. 2. Measured: preselected value `""`. With exactly one candidate it should be chosen. |
| DF-3 | med | open | **"No recorded differences" is the answer a writer gets for two chapters full of prose.** The diff compares each chapter's *last event's snapshots*, so two chapters with events, scenes and 880 words of text report no differences until someone has set character states by hand. The sentence is technically true and completely misleading; it should say what it compared and what it needs. |

## 21. Which overlays close on Escape — and which don't

Not a general grumble: measured in one run, so a stuck key or a dead page would
have shown up on every line instead of two.

```
Writer's Brief      open → Escape → closed   ✓
Continuity Checker  open → Escape → closed   ✓
Recent changes      open → Escape → STILL OPEN
Chapter Diff        open → Escape → STILL OPEN
```

The first three are opened from the same top-bar cluster, one beside the other.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| X-11 | med | **fixed** | **Escape closes some overlays and not others, with no pattern a user could learn.** `WritersBriefPanel` and `ContinuityChecker` register their own `keydown` handlers; `RecentChangesPanel` (`src/features/history/RecentChangesPanel.tsx`), `ChapterDiffModal` (`src/features/diff/ChapterDiffModal.tsx`) and `HelpPanel` (`src/features/help/HelpPanel.tsx`) register none, because both are hand-rolled overlays rather than the shared `Dialog`. Backdrop click closes both, so neither traps you — but the key that works everywhere else silently does nothing. **Fixed:** all three now register the same handler — the Help panel turned out to have the same gap, found when a test could not click past its full-screen overlay. `e2e/overlayDismissal.spec.ts` drives all four in one test, so a broken key would take every line down together rather than looking like a real result. |
| X-12 | med | **fixed** | **Chapter Diff's close button has no accessible name.** Measured: `text="" aria-label=null title=null` — a bare `<X>` icon in the header. A screen reader announces "button". Compare the shared `Dialog`, which gives its close button an `sr-only` "Close". **Fixed:** the panel is now a labelled `role="dialog"` and its close button carries `aria-label="Close chapter diff"`. |
| X-13 | med | **fixed** | **One Escape closes a confirm *and* the dialog behind it.** Restoring a scene version opens a confirm stacked over Scene history. Escape — the natural way to back out of a confirm — dismissed **both**, measured: `confirm 0, history 0`. Because `Dialog` listens on `document` and never checks whether it is topmost, cancelling the inner decision also throws away the outer context. Part of **X-10**. |

**The Recent changes drawer is otherwise good** — a plain reverse-chronological
list of journalled operations (*Added event "The gate"*, *Added chapter "The
Road"*, …) with relative timestamps. One note: only the topmost row carries an
*Undo*, which is correct for a linear stack but is never explained, and the
other rows look identical and inert.

## 22. Reading mode

Downloading a book from the Library drops you straight into it. It is a real
second product: its own warm sepia theme, a serif face, a reduced nav (no
Manuscript, Structure, or Corkboard), and a dashboard whose every figure is
scoped to how far you have read — *"6 / Characters / you have met so far"*,
*"maps you have reached"*, *"between characters you have met"*. Advancing the
cursor from ch.1 to ch.3 took the cast from 6 to 10, and the roster carries an
honest notice: *"Reading mode — 44 characters not yet met by chapter 1 are
hidden. Move the chapter cursor forward to reveal them."* The idea is good and
mostly well executed.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RD-1** | **med** | **fixed** | **The spoiler guard fails open for entities with no recorded appearance.** `isRevealed` (`src/lib/spoilers.ts:135`) returns `true` for any entity that appears in no event, documented as a deliberate choice so standalone reference material isn't hidden forever. In *Philosopher's Stone* that class is 3 of 50 characters, 1 of 16 items and 10 of 40 locations, and they bypass the cursor on every screen that lists them. Measured leaks at chapter 1, after excluding everything the reader's own book already prints (see the correction below): **Charlie Weasley** on Characters, Maps, Relationships and Arc; **Flying Motorcycle** on Items; **Godric's Hollow** on Maps. Two causes, both fixable: the fail-open default, and a fixture leaving those entities linked to no event. For a guard, fail-**closed** with an explicit opt-out — a `revealAt: 'always'` flag for genuine reference material — is the safer default, and would make the fixture's gaps visible instead of silent. |
| **RD-2** | **high** | **fixed** | **The guarantee spec cannot catch RD-1.** `e2e/spoilerGuarantee.spec.ts` walks every route asserting no unmet name appears — but its ground truth, `unmetNames` in `e2e/helpers/unmet.ts`, computes `hidden = f !== undefined && f > cursor`: the *same* fail-open rule as the implementation. An entity with no appearance is never counted as unmet, so it can never be reported as leaked. The test is real and does catch genuinely-linked characters; it is simply blind to the entire class that RD-1 is about, because it was written against the implementation's definition of "unmet" rather than the reader's. Fixing RD-1 without fixing this helper would leave the regression unguarded. |
| RD-3 | med | open | **The screen you land on is the one screen that never says "reading mode".** Measured: the phrase appears 0 times on the dashboard, where the Library drops you, and the mode is inferable only from a changed theme and sublabels like "you have met so far". Every roster explains itself properly. The landing screen should too, and should say how to leave. |
| RD-4 | low | open | **`Character Arc` shows an em-dash where every other card shows a number.** `—` reads as "unknown" rather than "nothing yet"; the five cards beside it all show a count. |
| RD-5 | med | **fixed** | **Reading mode inherits X-7 at its worst.** Character cards on the reading-mode roster are not links or buttons — measured **0** links in `main`. A reference companion whose entire job is "tell me who this is" gives the reader no way to open anyone from the cast list by keyboard. **Fixed by X-7** — the roster cards are links now, in reading mode as well as writing mode. `readingMode.spec.ts` had encoded the old behaviour in its locator (`main div.cursor-pointer`, with a comment saying "Roster cards are clickable divs, not buttons"), which is exactly the kind of test that quietly pins a defect in place; it now clicks the link. |

### What the fix did, and what it turned up

`RD-2` first, so the guard had something that could fail: `unmet.ts` now counts an
entity with no appearance as unmet (`f === undefined || f > cursor`). The
guarantee spec immediately went red with **16 leaks across 6 routes** — Charlie
Weasley on Characters, Maps, Relationships and Arc; Trevor on four; Godric's
Hollow, Hogwarts Castle and London on Maps; Flying Motorcycle on Items.

`RD-1` then made `isRevealed` fail closed. That is affordable precisely because
"all chapters" still returns `true`, so an unplaced entity is late rather than
lost — the reveal-all control brings it straight back. Fifteen of the sixteen
leaks closed.

The sixteenth was a **second, unrelated gap**, found only because the guard could
finally report it: a faction's *Territories* list rendered regions and location
markers straight from Dexie without passing either through the gate. Now fixed
(`FactionsView.tsx`), and it is the kind of bug that only ever surfaces when a
test is allowed to fail.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| RD-6 | med | **fixed** | **A faction's territories bypassed the reveal gate.** `mapRegions` and `locationMarkers` were queried by `factionId` and rendered directly, so a faction's holdings could name a place the reader had not reached. Both now go through `gate.filter`. |
| RD-7 | med | **fixed** | **The factions list itself is never gated, and disagrees with search.** `gate.filter` is applied to a faction's members, stance and territories, but never to the roster of factions — so every faction in the world is listed at chapter 1, descriptions included. `SearchPalette.tsx:115` gates factions by membership (`isRevealed(member) && hasReached(startEvent)`), so the same faction can be hidden in search and listed on the Factions page at the same cursor. One of the two is wrong; the search rule looks right. **Fixed:** the rule moved into `useFactionReveal`, which both screens now share, so they cannot drift apart again. At chapter one of *Philosopher's Stone* the roster keeps *The Dursley Household* and drops *Voldemort and His Servants* and *Slytherin House*. Also fixed the last spoiler-guarantee failure by rewording one faction description that happened to contain a location's full name — the collision was in authored prose, not a listing, so the fix was the copy rather than the matcher. |

### Found while testing the fixes above

Two defects that no amount of screenshot-reading would have surfaced — both came
out of trying to *write a test* and finding the app would not cooperate.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| ON-1 | **high** | **fixed** | **"Skip and explore on my own" did nothing.** The dashboard keeps the onboarding wizard mounted via a latch that arms whenever the world has no timeline *or no events*. Skipping set the latch false — and the effect immediately set it back, because the trigger condition was still true. So the escape hatch was a no-op for **every world the wizard appears for**, and a new user could not reach their own dashboard without first creating an event through the wizard. Fixed with a separate "dismissed" flag the latch respects. Guarded by `e2e/readingModeToggle.spec.ts`. |
| ON-2 | med | **fixed** | **The wizard does not notice work done elsewhere.** Create a timeline *and* a chapter on the Timeline screen, return to the dashboard, and it still opens at step 1 of 4: *"Your story begins with a moment — give your timeline a name."* The latch keys off `eventCount === 0`, so the wizard is right that something is missing, but it asks for the one thing the writer has already done. It should open at the step that matches the world's actual state. **Fixed** the cheaper way: the wizard triggers on `timelineCount === 0` alone, so it greets a world with nothing in it and leaves alone one that has been started. |


### Correction to RD-1, from the depth pass

The first version of RD-1 led with *"Nicolas Flamel is on the roster at chapter
1 — the book's central late reveal."* **That was wrong, and the severity has
been dropped from high to med because of it.**

Re-running the check against the project's own definition of benign text — the
book's title, description, and chapter titles, all printed in the reader's
physical copy — shows **"Nicolas Flamel" is the title of chapter 13**. It is on
the contents page of the paperback. PlotWeave showing that name gives away
nothing the reader's own book does not, which is precisely the rationale
`e2e/helpers/unmet.ts` already documents. *Trevor* likewise falls under the
short-name threshold and is no more identifying than "the toad".

My first pass used an ad-hoc benign list rather than the real one, and the
headline example did not survive contact with it. The mechanism is still real —
the orphan class does bypass the cursor, and RD-2 still means nothing can catch
it — but it is a latent hole with three modest leaks today, not a spoiled book.

### And the part that works: the gate holds everywhere else

Same run, all eleven reading-mode routes, against every character, item and
location the reader has demonstrably not reached:

```
dashboard  timeline  characters  maps  items  relationships
calendar   arc       lore        factions     knowledge
                    → LATE-leak: 0 on every one
```

**44 late characters, 15 late items and 29 late locations, and not one of them
appears anywhere.** For everything the gate has data about, it is airtight
across the whole app — including screens like Arc, Factions and Knowledge that
nothing in this review had previously opened under a cursor. That is the
stronger half of the story and it should not be lost behind RD-1.

**The Library itself is good** and needs no findings: honest sizes on every
button (`Download (323 KB)`), per-book counts, a blurb, a rights notice on each
entry, and a download that lands you in the world with the cursor already at the
opening moment rather than at "all chapters".

---

## 23. Phone widths (390×844)

Swept every world-scoped route at 390px, measuring page overflow and tap-target
size rather than eyeballing screenshots.

**The layout itself is sound and deserves saying so.** `documentElement.scrollWidth`
equals `clientWidth` — **390 on every single screen**. Nothing pushes the page
sideways. The nav collapses to a hamburger, the cursor chip shortens to `Ch.1`,
the pacing curve redraws at width, and the Character Arc grid (2004px wide) scrolls
inside its own container instead of dragging the page with it. That is more than
most apps this size manage.

The findings are about what happens *inside* that correct frame.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PH-1** | **high** | **fixed** | **The map does not fit its content on a phone.** Measured, same world, same wait, one run: **desktop 1440×900 → 5 of 5 markers visible; phone 390×844 → 2 of 5**. **Cause:** both `fitBounds` and `getBoundsZoom` clamp to the map's current `minZoom`, and Leaflet's default is 0 — the zoom at which a `CRS.Simple` image draws 1:1. `MapContainer` sets no `minZoom`, so any image larger than its container could never be fitted; the fit clamped to 0 and the map opened on the middle of the image. `setMinZoom` was then called *after* the fit, too late to help it. Fixed by opening the floor before fitting and adopting the fitted zoom as the new floor afterwards, so a reader still cannot zoom out past the map. Guarded by `e2e/mapFit.spec.ts`, which fails by 125px without the change. Three markers sit outside the viewport on arrival, and two labels cross the edge — *"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft…"* spans `[207..590]` on a 390px-wide screen, so most of it is simply not there. The background image layer loads in both cases, so this is the initial fit-to-bounds, not a loading race. On the one screen whose entire job is showing where things are, a phone user arrives looking at empty ground. |
| PH-2 | med | **fixed** | **The time-cursor controls are 20×24px.** `Previous moment`, `Next moment` and `View all chapters` measure 20×24; `Play story on the map` is 18×18. These drive the time cursor — the app's central concept — and on a phone they are less than half the 44px WCAG target, set side by side, with a destructive-adjacent `✕` (clear cursor) in the same cluster. **Fixed:** the step buttons are now 32×32, matching every other icon button in the top bar, and the `✕` is set apart from *next moment* rather than sitting 2px from it. Deliberately **not** `.pw-tap` — that utility centres a 44px hit area and its own guidance is to use it only on well-spaced controls; here *previous moment* sits ~6px from the brand button that navigates out of the world, so overlapping 44px zones would make the neighbours easier to hit by accident, not harder. Reaching a true 44px needs the bar re-laid-out, which is a design change rather than a fix. |
| PH-3 | med | **fixed** | **Chapter rows spend their width on controls and truncate the only identifying text.** At 390px: *"Ch. 2 — The Vanish…"*, *"Ch. 4 — The Keepe…"*, while `Set Active` + an open-in-new icon + a delete icon take roughly 40% of the row. The title is the one thing that tells the rows apart. *Left open deliberately:* the fix is a trade — shrink `Set Active` to an icon on narrow screens and the row reads better but its most-used action gets less discoverable. That is a design call. **Resolved** the other way: the row wraps below `sm`, so the title gets the whole first line and the controls fall to a second — spending vertical space, which a phone has more of, and keeping every control labelled. |
| PH-4 | low | **partly corrected, partly fixed** | Filed as "the easiest thing on the row to hit by accident". **Half of that was wrong:** deleting a chapter opens a `ConfirmDialog` naming the chapter and warning that its events go too, so a mis-tap costs a dismissal, not a chapter. What *was* real is that the button had **no accessible name at all** — measured `text="" aria-label=null title=null`, and the only nameless control on the entire timeline screen, where a screen reader announced it as "button" next to a properly-titled *Open chapter detail*. Now labelled, and `e2e/buttonNames.spec.ts` sweeps the screen for the whole class rather than that one instance. |

**Not filed, checked and cleared:** the `right≈478` overflows reported by my
first sweep on six screens are the bottom playback bar's scrubber strip, which
scrolls horizontally by design and does not move the page. The Character Arc
table's 2004px width is likewise contained.

---

## 24. Help, settings, the writer dashboard, manuscript import, the sequel wizard

The last of the never-opened screens. Three of the five need no findings at all,
which is worth recording as carefully as the problems.

**The reading-mode setting has the best explanatory copy in the app:** *"Present
this world to someone reading the book rather than writing it. Characters, items
and places the story has not introduced yet are hidden until the chapter cursor
reaches them, and the writing screens step aside."* — followed, when it is on, by
*"If this world came from the library, note that downloading it again restores
the original and discards your changes — export it first if you want to keep
them."* That warns about a destructive interaction nobody would have guessed at.

**Manuscript import** explains its own format without being asked: *"`#`/`##` or
'Chapter …' headings become chapters, and lines like `* * *` split scenes"*, with
both a file picker and a paste box.

**The sequel wizard is a genuinely well-designed feature.** *"Pick what carries
over — relationships continue from where they ended, and the previous story can
become reference lore. The new book is a copy; editing it won't change the
original."* Three checkboxes, each explained in a clause: seed an opening chapter
at each character's ending state; turn the story into "Previously…" lore, one
recap page per chapter; carry world-building lore forward.

**The writer dashboard** is dense and useful — 17 chapters / 58 events, 43 alive
/ 7 dead, 100% arc snapshot coverage (58/58), Recent Events with chapter
attribution, a Scene Status bar, and a Cast Balance panel whose best line is a
sentence rather than a number: *"Draco Malfoy — drops out for 4 chapters
mid-story."* That is the kind of observation a writer actually acts on.

|---|---|---|---|
| SQ-1 | med | **fixed** | **The sequel wizard is filed under export.** Measured on the selector: the word "sequel" appears **0** times at rest, **0** on hover, and **1** only after opening a world card's overflow menu — whose own label is *"More export options"*. The control is properly named (see SQ-2, withdrawn); the problem is that its name advertises exports and nothing else, so starting book two of a series — for an app whose pitch is tracking a series — sits behind a menu a writer has no reason to open unless they want to export. Renaming the menu, or promoting the sequel action out of it, would be enough. **Fixed:** the menu is *More actions* rather than *More export options*, so its name no longer contradicts half its contents. |
| SQ-2 | — | **withdrawn** | **Filed as "three unlabelled buttons on every world card" — that was wrong.** All three carry `title` attributes (*Export world (single file)*, *More export options*, *Delete world*), which do contribute to the accessible name: `getByRole('button', { name: … })` matches each one. My probe logged only `aria-label` and text content, so a real label looked like an absent one. Nothing to fix here. |
| HP-1 | med | **fixed** | **The Help panel documents screens the current mode has removed.** In a reading-mode world it still lists *"Corkboard & manuscript"*, *"Timeline & chapter AI"*, and the other writing topics, though the nav has hidden all of them. Help should follow the mode, or say which topics apply to the writer's view. **Fixed:** sections describing screens and tools reading mode removes are marked `writerOnly` and drop out of the panel. The test pairs the hidden topics with ones that must survive, so "hidden" cannot quietly mean "the panel failed to render", and checks they all return when reading mode is turned off. |
| ST-2 | low | **fixed** | **The reading-mode toggle labels its state, not its action, in one direction only.** On: *"Reading mode is on"* — a status. Off: *"Turn on reading mode"* — an imperative. So the control changes grammatical mood depending on state, and in the "on" state gives no hint that clicking changes anything. It also carries no `aria-pressed` (measured: `null`) despite being a toggle, so assistive tech is told neither that it toggles nor what it currently is. **Fixed:** the label is an action in both directions (*Turn on* / *Turn off reading mode*), `aria-pressed` carries the state, and the sentence "Reading mode is on." moved beside the button where it belongs. |
| X-14 | low | **fixed** | **An em-dash stands in for "nothing to report" on stat cards, ambiguously.** `Continuity — check for issues` on the writer dashboard, and `Character Arc —` in reading mode, sit beside five cards showing real numbers. On the Continuity card especially, `—` could mean "no issues", "not run yet", or "unknown", and those are very different things to a writer about to hand in a draft. (Supersedes **RD-4**, which is the same tic on a different card.) **Fixed:** a tile with no count is an *action*, not a statistic, so it now shows a chevron — "this goes somewhere" — instead of a value that looks missing. |

**Not filed, my error rather than the app's:** an earlier probe reported the
reading-mode toggle as having no control role and being unclickable. It is an
ordinary `<Button>`; my probe was looking for `switch`/`checkbox` roles and so
never clicked it. The toggle works — `Reading mode is on` → `Turn on reading
mode`, and the nav regains Manuscript, Corkboard and Structure immediately.

## 25. Depth pass: overlays at 390px

X-10 was filed from a source read — no `role`, no `aria-modal`, no focus trap on
the shared `Dialog`. This pass measured what that costs on a phone, where an
escaped focus ring has nowhere good to go. Ten Tab presses per overlay, counting
how many land outside it:

```
Add Character dialog        7 of 10 Tabs land OUTSIDE   ← focus escapes
Generate Characters dialog  5 of 10 Tabs land OUTSIDE   ← focus escapes
Search palette              0 of 10 Tabs land outside   (trapped)
```

**The palette is the control, and it is the proof.** All three ran in one pass,
same key, same viewport. The only one that holds focus is the one already using
`useFocusTrap` — the hook added to `SearchPalette` earlier in this review. So
X-10 is not just real, it is real *and* the remedy is already in the codebase,
applied once, three lines from being applied everywhere.

| ID | Severity | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| X-10a | — | — | *Measurement supporting **X-10**, not a separate finding.* On a phone, tabbing out of an open dialog puts the focus ring on nav links and page content behind a full-screen overlay the user cannot see past. Sighted keyboard users lose the ring entirely; screen-reader users are never told a dialog opened. `useFocusTrap` already exists and is already proven here. |

**Otherwise the overlays behave well at 390px**, and the numbers say so:

- **Nothing overflows horizontally.** Both dialogs measure `[16..374]` inside a
  390px viewport — a consistent 16px gutter, no sideways scroll.
- **The tallest dialog in the app still fits.** Generate Characters occupies
  `[42..802]` of 844px with its prompt block, four numbered steps, paste box and
  footer. The paste box is visible without scrolling and *Copy prompt* is
  reachable — the two things that flow actually needs.

**Checked and cleared, against my own expectation:** the phone top bar shows only
a hamburger, the cursor chip and search, and I expected to find Writer's Brief,
Continuity Checker, Recent changes and Help simply missing below `lg`. They are
not. Measured phone vs desktop in one run: all four are absent from the top bar
at 390px and **all four are present in the nav menu behind the hamburger**. That
is a deliberate, correct responsive relocation, and no finding.

## Still not reviewed

Kept honest: this list only shrinks when a screen has actually been driven and
looked at.

### Whole passes, each a session of its own

Both outstanding depth passes are done — the reveal gate across all eleven
reading-mode routes (section 22) and the overlays at 390px (section 25). What
remains is narrower:

- **The chapter-detail editor at 390px** — the one writing surface not measured
  at phone width. WR-1 (a five-line textarea) will read differently there, and
  Focus mode is the obvious mitigation but has not been driven on a phone.
- **A second book.** Every reading-mode measurement in this document comes from
  *Philosopher's Stone*. RD-1's severity depends on how many orphaned entities a
  given fixture has, and that is a per-book number — the other nineteen library
  worlds are unmeasured.

### Screens never opened

*(This list is now empty. Every screen named in earlier passes has been driven.)*

### Parts of screens

- **The route detail panel** — blocked by **RT-1**, now understood.
- **Scene history with many versions** — only a two-version history has been
  seen, so nothing is known about how the list behaves at twenty.
- **The Relationship States panel** in chapter detail — the Character States and
  Writer's Notes panels beside it are reviewed; this one has not been seen.
- **The Writer's Brief with a cursor set** — only its empty state is known, and
  **WB-1**/**WB-2** describe that state alone.
