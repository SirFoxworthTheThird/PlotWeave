/**
 * Where the first-run guide got to, kept across a reload.
 *
 * N14, from a blind writer run: the four-step guide held its progress in
 * component state, and the condition that summons it is "this world has no
 * timeline" — which **step 1 makes false**. So reloading between step 1 and
 * step 2 dropped the writer on the dashboard with steps 2 to 4 simply skipped,
 * and no way back in. The guide is the app's own answer to "what do I do
 * first", and a refresh ended it.
 *
 * Stored per world in `localStorage`, the way this app already keeps the
 * dismissed dashboard suggestions, the structure template and the manuscript
 * word goal. It is a note about where the writer is, not world data: it never
 * travels in `.pwk`, and losing it costs a resumed guide and nothing else.
 *
 * `'done'` is stored as well as progress, and that matters for the same reason:
 * "skip and explore on my own" was component state too, so on a world with no
 * timeline — which is every world the guide appears for — a reload after
 * skipping brought it straight back.
