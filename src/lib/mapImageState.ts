/**
 * Which of five things is true about a map layer's picture.
 *
 * The Maps screen already told two of these apart — a layer with no `imageId`
 * at all, and one naming a blob that is not in the store (a library world
 * downloaded without its `.pwb`). A reader run found a third that neither
 * covers: *The Woman in White*'s layers name blobs that **are** present, whose
 * records hold a `url` pointing at `upload.wikimedia.org`. Every image in the
 * Library is stored that way. On a train the record resolves, the screen draws
 * its whole frame — sidebar, markers, zoom controls, scale bar — and the canvas
 * behind them is blank, with nothing said. Three explanations are then
 * available to the reader and two of them are the app's fault.
 *
 * The decision is here rather than inline because getting `loading` and
 * `unreachable` the wrong way round flashes "could not be loaded" on every map
 * before it draws, and that is invisible in a screenshot.
