/**
 * Take a copy of every picture this world links to.
 *
 * PlotWeave's first promise is that a story never leaves the device, and
 * pictures are the documented exception: a picture is either bytes you uploaded
 * or a **link** to somebody else's server. That is why a library download is
 * 363 KB rather than 15 MB, and it is also why a downloaded book's maps do not
 * draw on a train — and why a `.pwk` kept as a backup slowly stops matching
 * what it looked like, as links rot.
 *
 * So the copy is offered rather than assumed. It is the choice of whoever is
 * about to get on a plane, and the count is shown before anything is fetched.
 *
 * The size is not shown beforehand, because it is not known: a linked picture's
 * bytes are only measurable once fetched, and a number invented from the image
 * count would be a guess wearing a number's clothes. What can be said honestly
 * is how many pictures and how many sites, and that is what is said.
